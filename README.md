# Landing Page `{1}`

This webpage will function as a basic, single-page, Bootstrap 4 landing page designed to show off simple text and images to the viewer, such as general company information for a small business, using a clean and modern format.  Developed in Jan '19 by Daniel Martin with no idea how to use GitHub, Git, the basic syntax formatting of .md files, etc.  Let's see how my first project goes!

**Project Files**
- index.html
- style.css
- script.js
- /img img_{#}.jpg

The general style and layout of this page is courtesy of one of the first project ideas on the p1xt-guides "job-ready-javascript-edition-3.0" here on GitHub.  If you're also a beginner like me, definitely search it and check out that guide if you haven't already.  It is already teaching me a lot of useful information!
